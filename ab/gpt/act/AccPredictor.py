Fine-tune Qwen3-8B (Unsloth 4-bit) for outcome prediction with early stopping.

Pipeline:
  1. data_preprocessing   — nn_dataset API → llm_finetuning_data JSONL/CSV
  2. prepare_llm_datasets — raw JSONL → ChatML train/val/test splits
  3. train_model          — QLoRA fine-tune with validation + early stopping
  4. test_model           — evaluate on test set, save predictions and metrics
